## Hangman Game

Description:

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player must uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. Each wrong guess brings the stick figure closer to being fully drawn on the gallows. The player has only 6 chances to guess the correct word before the game is lost.

The game offers multiple difficulty levels:

Easy → short, simple words

Medium → moderately challenging words

Hard → longer and more complex words

Test your vocabulary, sharpen your spelling skills, and see if you can outsmart the hangman before time runs out!
