   Welcome to "Hangman Game!"
**********************************

Description:
Hangman is a fun guessing game where a secret word 
is chosen randomly. Your goal is to guess the word one 
letter at a time. 

Be careful! Each wrong guess brings the hangman closer 
to his fate. You only have 6 tries...

Good luck!
